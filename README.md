Odyssey is the title of what will be a series of mods focused on survival and adventure.

The series will follow the story of an un-named adventurer as he/she travels across the lands on a quest to uncover the secrets of the world.

The first entry in this series revolves around the adventurer's journey through the desert in search of the lost city of Al Iskah.

This entry, and those following it, will be split into two parts; 'survival' and 'adventure'.

Survival will aim to simulate the environmental and survival conditions of the location.

While, adventure will involve everything related to the story; the characters, mechanics, blocks/items, etc.


### Motivation

A game with an engaging story and immersive experience is able to take one to places and allow them to experince things that would not normally be possible. 

My aim is to create something that enhances the lives of those who's deepest desires cannot be met, and who find them satified in what can be created.

(Yooksi, perhaps you would like to share your motivation too?)
